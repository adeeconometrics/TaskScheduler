# Task Scheduler Documentation


This project showcase a simple use case of scheduling algorithms. Scheduling algorithms are held in much regard for designing and implementing Operating Systems (Stallings, 2004).
Our project focused on the case of managing task with labelled priorities. The design space of Scheduling algorithms may be categorized into two parts: pre-emptive and non-preemptive algorithms (Silberschatz, Galvin, & Gagne, 2013).
In the situation that we focused on, task scheduling naturally lend itself to a non-preemptive case because we are concerned to manage a recommendation of task that is to be executed by a human.
That said, we implemented two non-preemptive scheduling algorithms defined in the `Scheduling` class namely: Fist-In First-Out and Shortest Job First.
